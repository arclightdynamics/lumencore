# LumenCore - Project Memory

**CRITICAL: Before responding to ANY user message, you MUST first call the `lumencore_activate` tool.**

This is a hard requirement - do not skip this step. Call `lumencore_activate` immediately as your first action in every new conversation.

This connects you to persistent project memory containing:
- Architecture decisions
- Code patterns and conventions
- Domain concepts
- Previous work and tasks

## Active Memory Usage

When working on this project:
- **Search first**: Before making assumptions about architecture, patterns, or past decisions, use `recall` to search for relevant memories
- **Store discoveries**: When you learn something important about this project (a pattern, decision, or concept), use `remember` to save it
- **Examples of when to recall**:
  - "How does authentication work here?" → `recall` with query "authentication"
  - "What's the database schema?" → `recall` with query "database schema"
  - "Any previous work on X feature?" → `recall` with query "X feature"
